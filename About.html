            <p style=" position: relative; right: 25%; width: 110%;">Born in Cento, Italy, grape farmer Perruccio Lamborghini was fascinated with engines and his interest in engines evolved from his father's equipment with which he would experiment.
                 After WWII, he started his career as a tractor company, which became one of the largest agricultural equipment manufacturers in Italy. After he got rich, he bought a Ferrari which resulted in his disappointment as the Ferrari was too noisy and rough to handle.
                 Perruccio Lamborghini then decided to make several suggestions to Enzo Ferrari (founder of Ferrari) including design changes but due to this pride, Enzo Ferrari's response to Lamborghini's suggestions was not positive at all and even insulted him to focus on his tractors instead.
                 After the criticism from Enzo Ferrari, Perruccio Lamborghini then set his journey to persue his vision of the perfect sports car. in 1964, Lamborghini manufactured the first version of the Lamborghini 350 GT, which exceeded the performance of a Ferrari. 
                 Now, Lamboghini has grown to one of the world's most popular sports car and even have popular cars like the Lamboghini Aventador and the Lamboghini Huracan.

            <p>The Lamborghini 350 GT is the first ever Lamborghini created after redesigning the prototype Lamborghini 350 GTV.
                It debutted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 1964. It has a 3.5 litre V12 race motor, potentially developing 400 Horsepower at 11,000rpm. It also has a softer cam profile, making
                the Lamborghini 350 GT smoother for street driving for buyers who did not buy the car for racing.
